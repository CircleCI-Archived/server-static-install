# Static Installer

:wave:, this repository contains the scripts required to install a copy of
CircleCI Server on non-AWS environments.
It is currently still only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, although 16.04 should also work.

If you are looking to install Server on a cloud provider, or require the ability to launch remote_docker or machine builds, you should look at [enterprise-setup](https://github.com/circleci/enterprise-setup).

## Documentation

You can find instructions on settings up static here: [circleci-docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/non-aws/).
